This .zip file contains recordings of wind noise with the following structure


./audio_booth

Signals recorded in a laboratory setup in a low reverberant environment with no other background noise for analysis and evaluation purpose of the single and dual microphone characteristics. The following setups were considered:

./audio_booth/constant_wind/mic_dist_2cm/
- constant air stream 
- microphone distance 2cm

./audio_booth/constant_wind/mic_dist_10cm/
- constant air stream 
- microphone distance 10cm

./audio_booth/varying_wind/mic_dist_2cm/
- varying air stream over time
- microphone distance 2cm

./audio_booth/varying_wind/mic_dist_10cm/
- varying air stream over time
- microphone distance 10cm

./outdoors

Signals recorded outdoors for test and evaluation purpose. These signals also contains other background noises as they where recorded in a realistic scenario. Two single microphone signals are provided with normal and strong wind speed conditions during the recordings.



All signals are stored as wav files with 16kHz sampling rate.
